[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/swel.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=plastic)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/swel)

[Spectral analysis](https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2099.1/6034/06.pdf?sequence=7) of [real time raw spectral wave information](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data_spec.shtml) from [NOAA](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/), calculating trends by plotting spectral moments.

This is a python package that can be downloaded with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/swel/).

The eventual goal is to build with tests and deploy using something like [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pypi/).
